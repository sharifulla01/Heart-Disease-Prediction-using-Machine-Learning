# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical and lifestyle factors. Leveraging a range of machine learning algorithms, the goal is to build a model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at higher risk of heart disease, which allows for timely interventions and treatment plans.

Features:
Dataset: The dataset used contains medical and lifestyle variables such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, glucose levels, and smoking habits. Each record corresponds to an individual's health profile and whether they have been diagnosed with heart disease.

Selected Features for Prediction:

Year (yr)
Cholesterol level (cholesterol)
Weight (weight)
Glucose level (gluc)
Diastolic blood pressure (ap_lo)
Systolic blood pressure (ap_hi)
Activity level (active)
Smoking habit (smoke)
Machine Learning Algorithms:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC-AUC
Key Objectives:
Preprocess and clean the dataset to handle missing values and normalize features.
Explore feature importance using techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
Apply machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease.
Compare models based on performance metrics to choose the best-fit model for deployment.
Technologies Used:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for model development and evaluation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
